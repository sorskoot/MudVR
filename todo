Initial:
    ✔ Setup build pipeline @done(19-09-26 22:42)

Dungeon Generator:
    Generate a dungeon based on a specific random seed.
    Dungeons need to be 
        ~ random
        ~ endless
        ~ the same everytime with a specific seed
        ~ 'rooms' need to be small
        ~ big world of rooms, connected in 3 dimensions
        ~ different styles like biomes
Room:
    ☐ 4 walls, a floor and a ceiling
    

World state:
    Stored in an Azure Table as soon as anything changes
    Azure function to retreive data on entering a room
    Azure functions need to send a push/websocket call when someone changes a room
    Azure function to save data on a change

Ideas:
    Use a similar texturing trick as in the 2017 entry for JS13K. With changing the color of a texture based on a different palette. So biomes are colored specificly.
